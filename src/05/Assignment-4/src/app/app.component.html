      <ol>
        <li>Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even</li>
        <li>
          The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the
          game
        </li>
        <li>
          When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number)
          should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval())
        </li>
        <li>The event should be listenable from outside the component</li>
        <li>
          When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted
          (clearInterval(ref))
        </li>
        <li>
          A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted,
          the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers)
        </li>
        <li>
          Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components
        </li>
        <li>
          Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text
          differently in both components
        </li>
      </ol>
