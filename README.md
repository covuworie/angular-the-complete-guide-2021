# Angular - The Complete Guide (2021 Edition)

This repository contains my code solutions to the Udemy course [Angular - The Complete Guide (2021 Edition)](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-guide-to-angular-2/).

## Prerequisites

1. Install [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Install the [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local).
3. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (optional).

## Running the code

The code is in the `src` folder. The course is split into numbered sections (see below for a list of high-level sections) and each section section is split into numbered lessons (see inside each section folder for a list of lessons). Each lesson is a separate Angular project.

1. Run `npm install` from the project folder to install the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.
2. Run `npm start` from the project folder to launch the Angular development server. This command will launch the application in your default web browser and will watch for and compile changes to source files.

## Deployment

If you wish to deploy the app then run the command `npm run build` from the project folder. This will create a `dist` directory with the application build artifacts. You can then deploy this folder on any web server that you want.
